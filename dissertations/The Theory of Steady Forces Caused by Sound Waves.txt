Title: The Theory of Steady Forces Caused by Sound Waves

Content:

A general expression is derived for the force owing to radiation pressure acting on an object of any shape and having an arbitrary normal boundary impedance.
It is shown that boundary layer losses may lead to forces that are several orders of magnitude greater than the forces owing to classical radiation pressure.
Steady forces arising from an asymmetric wave form are compared with the other forces.
A sound wave, consisting of equal parts of fundamental and second harmonic components,
can cause forces ten or more orders of magnitude greater than the forces owing to radiation pressure to be exerted on small particles.
